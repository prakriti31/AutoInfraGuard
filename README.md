# AutoInfraGuard
Self-Healing ML Pipeline Debugger for Production Systems

To stand out for an **ML Infra role at LinkedIn USA**, you need a project that shows:

* Deep systems thinking (scalability, optimization, infra design)
* ML/NLP depth (model lifecycle, distributed training, serving)
* Practical value (real-world utility or LinkedIn-aligned goals like job matching, career paths, spam moderation, or user content optimization)

---

## 🔥 Project Idea: **AutoInfraGuard – Self-Healing ML Pipeline Debugger for Production Systems**

### 🔍 What it is:

A **self-healing, explainable ML infra watchdog** that detects, diagnoses, and recovers failing stages in large-scale ML pipelines (e.g., feature drift, data skew, stale models, training-serving skew), **with NLP-powered root-cause explanations** and automatic recovery workflows.

### 🧠 Why it's valuable:

Most ML infra teams (like LinkedIn's) struggle with:

* Hidden bugs in production pipelines
* Model degradation over time
* Lack of explainability for failures
* Tedious debugging of pipeline stages

This solves **real pain points** and shows a **unique blend** of:

* Infra engineering (monitoring, alerting, containerization)
* ML ops (tracking drift/skew, model freshness)
* NLP (interpreting logs, summarizing errors)
* Autonomy (automated fixes or recommendations)

---

## 🛠️ Core Features:

1. **Live Monitoring Layer**:

   * Hooks into ML pipeline components (e.g., feature store, model trainer, inference service)
   * Tracks anomalies in input distributions, training/serving skew, latency, and failure rates

2. **Explainable Error Layer (NLP)**:

   * Uses transformer-based summarizers on logs (e.g., BART or Longformer)
   * Classifies and ranks root causes
   * Auto-generates natural language "postmortems"

3. **Auto-Recovery/Recommendation Layer**:

   * Restarts stages, clears caches, retriggers model training, or suggests interventions
   * Uses rules + lightweight RL to learn optimal fixes

4. **Dashboard + Alerts**:

   * Visualizes drift, errors, model freshness, infra metrics
   * Slack/email alerts with English explanations

---

## 💡 Novelty:

* Not just a monitoring tool—**it self-heals**
* Combines **infra + ML + NLP** in one package
* Auto-explains *why* your pipeline broke, like a junior infra engineer
* Could plug into **LinkedIn’s Feature Store or Unified AI Infra**

---

## 🔧 Tech Stack:

* **Languages**: Python, Go (optional for speed)
* **ML**: scikit-learn, XGBoost, transformers (HuggingFace), Prometheus
* **Infra**: Docker, Kubernetes, Apache Airflow, MLflow, Grafana
* **NLP**: Log summarization using fine-tuned transformer models
* **Serving**: FastAPI or gRPC for API endpoints
* **Database**: PostgreSQL for logs and metrics, Redis for quick lookups

---

## 📈 Bonus:

* Add **LinkedIn API integration** to monitor scraping or spam detection systems
* Open-source it as a plug-in tool for Airflow or Kubeflow → **community impact**

---

Absolutely. Here's a **step-by-step implementation roadmap** to build **AutoInfraGuard**, broken down into **phases with specific tasks**, so you can steadily build and show off this powerful project.

---

## 🧱 PHASE 1: Setup a Simulated ML Pipeline (Baseline)

### ✅ Goal:

Build a minimal, modular ML pipeline you can later debug and monitor.

### 🛠️ Tasks:

1. **Choose a small ML task** (e.g., job title prediction, salary estimation, etc.)
2. Create a pipeline with:

   * Data ingestion (CSV/streaming)
   * Feature engineering
   * Model training (scikit-learn or XGBoost)
   * Inference API (FastAPI or Flask)
3. Containerize it with **Docker**.
4. Add **Airflow/Kubeflow** or even custom DAG logic to simulate a real pipeline.
5. Store metrics (latency, drift, etc.) in **Prometheus** or **SQLite/Postgres**.

---

## 🧠 PHASE 2: Drift & Skew Detector

### ✅ Goal:

Detect model drift and training-serving skew.

### 🛠️ Tasks:

1. Add a **feature distribution tracker** using:

   * JS divergence / Wasserstein distance
   * Compare training vs. live data
2. Monitor:

   * Data type mismatches
   * Missing features
   * Unexpected value ranges
3. Add a small **Grafana dashboard** to visualize distributions.

💡 **Tools**: `evidently`, `river`, `scikit-multiflow`, `drift-detection methods` (DDM, ADWIN)

---

## 🔍 PHASE 3: NLP-Powered Log Summarizer

### ✅ Goal:

Use NLP to summarize errors/failures in natural language.

### 🛠️ Tasks:

1. Log different pipeline errors: data schema mismatches, model failure, timeouts
2. Store logs in a structured form
3. Train/fine-tune an NLP summarizer:

   * Use a BART or T5 model on synthetic logs + explanations
   * Alternatively use prompt-based summarization (OpenAI, Claude, etc.)
4. Output:

   * English explanation of what failed
   * Suggested causes

💡 Dataset idea: create a small JSON dataset of errors → explanations, then fine-tune a model.

---

## 🤖 PHASE 4: Auto-Recovery Engine

### ✅ Goal:

Build logic to auto-fix or recommend fixes.

### 🛠️ Tasks:

1. Define **trigger conditions** (e.g., drift threshold > 0.2)
2. Define **action mappings**:

   * Drift → retrain model
   * Schema mismatch → rollback to previous schema
   * Crash → restart Docker container
3. Implement in logic in Python with Airflow hooks or shell scripts
4. Optional: use **Reinforcement Learning (Q-learning)** to improve fix choice over time

---

## 📊 PHASE 5: Alerting and Dashboard

### ✅ Goal:

Visual + Alert system to monitor everything.

### 🛠️ Tasks:

1. Connect pipeline + metrics to **Prometheus**
2. Build Grafana dashboard:

   * Drift timelines
   * Failure rates
   * Model freshness
3. Integrate email/Slack alerts with natural language summaries

---

## 🌐 Bonus PHASE 6: LinkedIn Relevance Layer

> Showcase you understand LinkedIn’s mission!

### 🛠️ Ideas:

* Integrate with **LinkedIn job data** (via scraping or Open Data) and use your infra to debug a job-matching model
* Add a “resume score predictor” and track drift over time (seasonal skills)
* Build an ML system to auto-detect spam comments/posts (simulate trust & safety)

#### ✅ 3. Prepare Dataset

Make sure you have the dataset at `data/job_data.csv`:

```csv
experience,education,job_title,salary
3,Bachelor,Data Scientist,90000
5,Master,ML Engineer,120000
2,Bachelor,ML Engineer,85000
6,PhD,AI Researcher,150000
```

#### ✅ 4. Train the Model

```bash
python app/model.py
```

This will generate `app/model.joblib`.

#### ✅ 5. Start the FastAPI Server

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload

Visit the API docs:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
```

Try this input on the Swagger UI:

```json
{
  "experience": 4,
  "education": "Master",
  "job_title": "ML Engineer"
}
```

You’ll get a predicted salary like:

```json
{"predicted_salary": 112500.0}
```

---

#### ✅ 6. Generate reports

```bash
python -c "from app.drift_detector import generate_combined_drift_report; generate_combined_drift_report('data/job_data.csv', 'data/live_data.csv', 'reports/drift_report.html')"
```

✅ Combined drift report saved at reports/drift_report.html

### 🐳 (Optional) Run with Docker

```bash
docker build -t autoinfraguard .
docker run -p 8000:8000 autoinfraguard
```

---
